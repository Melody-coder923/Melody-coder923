### Software & AI Projects | Open Source Contributions

- **Built AI-agent travel chatbot** with Agno, Groq, and ChromaDB; fine-tuned model weights and open-sourced them.
- **Open source contributor** to notable open-source projects including:
  - HuggingFace Transformers
  - LangChain
  - JAX
- **Studied the foundational paper "ZeRo"** and implemented a **DeepSpeed + PyTorch** project for efficient distributed training and evaluation, optimizing resource usage and training speed for large-scale deep learning tasks.
- **Implemented data parallelism for MNIST training** with JAX's shardmap sharding API and contributed to OSS JAX.
- **Built and extended Micrograd**, a minimal autograd engine, as part of self-study of Karpathy's Zero to Hero series:
  - Implemented the `Value` class, topological sort–based backpropagation, and dynamically constructed computation graph (DAG).
  - Added custom operations (e.g., exponentiation, ReLU, tanh), visualized graph structures, and built training loop for an MLP.
  - Reinforced understanding of the chain rule, gradient descent, and autograd principles through end-to-end implementation.
